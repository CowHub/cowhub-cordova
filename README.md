# cowhub-cordova

This is a mobile frontend for CowHub written in ES6 javascript running in a platform independent webview on Cordova.
Native calls to the camera are handled using the EzAR Cordova plugin. The interface is powered by React + Redux , using
Onsen UI to produce native looking applications on Android (and with some extra work IOS).
